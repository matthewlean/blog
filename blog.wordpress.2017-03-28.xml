		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Bristol Zoo project was the first set group project at Bournemouth. The brief stated that as a group we must come up with a way of incorporating digital experiences to the zoo. Whilst doing this we also had to use the Zoo’s archive or facts and photos and appeal to a 5-12 year old target audience. We decided to design an app with an Victorian theme, this would use textures such as maps and torn pages for the appearance or a journal. I worked on making the design of the app in photoshop, first starting with the part of the app tailored to younger children then going onto the adult section of the app.

For the Explorer’s Journal Section I used bright colours and simple layout as this would cater to the needs of a young child. I used a playful typeface as well as incorporating pictures following the journal/craft book style (which children may relate to). I achieved this by placing the image on a slant and using tape images on the corners like the child was adding the picture themselves. The idea behind the journal was that the children would look around the zoo using their map on the smart phone which would fill in by using their gps location. They would then visit the enclosures and by using QR codes found near the exhibit they would gain the information about the animal. This makes visiting each animal more exciting than just going from enclosure to enclosure and makes the experience of the zoo more enjoyable and technologically exciting.

After designing the children’s section of the app I then went onto design the adults section. This would include the archive of facts and images and present them in a cleaner and more formal way which would be more appealing to an older audience.

I changed the typeface from the original design on the left, as I thought it was unclear and would be hard to read on a mobile device, I still however kept with a formal typeface as this would appeal to the target audience of this section of the app and still be accessible to younger readers if they wished to learn more.The layout is very simple and I moved away from the aesthetics of a book/journal look as I believed that usability was more important than keeping to a childish theme.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the second group project I had to design a fire prevention / awareness scheme that was innovative and had a media solution. I came up with the idea of a game, where the player would play the victim of a fire in a home trying to escape. The game would be played on the computer and would also have smart phone integration. The name we came up with for this game was Fire Inferno. The interactive game was stylised on the game Mirrors Edge which is a free running game. The simplistic colour scheme of bright colours on a contrasting low hue background are very recognisable and therefore made the game more welcoming as a concept.

<img src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/mirrorsedge-on.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1076" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-519" />

<img src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/room-choice.jpg" alt="" width="1276" height="864" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-520" />

Difference choices you could make would be highlighted in red, a colour chosen for its connotations with danger and fire. Depending on your decision the outcome of the game would be different, similar to Dishonored a PC first person shooter where the players decisions would change the outcome of characters and the game’s ending.

As the game progressed the rooms would slowly become black and visibility would decrease, similar to that of an actual fire situation. If the player was fast enough and chose the right path they would escape and survive, but if they made poor decisions and chose the wrong path the game would end and they would meet their end. We chose this more interactive way of portraying fire safety as it fits more with today’s audience. They are used to seeing shocking images of fire safety and info-graphics alike, but reaching out in the form of a game is much more acceptable and relatable to this demographic.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Cinema 4D</h2>
When looking at Blender I realised that it was very similar to Cinema 4D which is a 3D rendering program that I used before. Many of the techniques of lighting and texturing were similar so this meant I only had to learn my way around the user interface to understand what I was doing.
Below are some of the work I did previously with Cinema 4D.

<center>
<img class="pimg wp-image-523 size-full alignleft" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1415" />
<img class="pimg alignleft wp-image-524 size-full alignleft" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1415" /></center>

<h2>Shape Series</h2>
<center>
<img class="pimg aligncenter wp-image-530 size-full" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ee.jpg" alt="" width="2480" height="3508" />
</center>

<h2>Depth of Field</h2>
For my first test piece inside blender I wanted to learn how to create Depth of Field using the camera. I wanted to do this as It was a technique I learned in C4D when I first started learning it and it made my work look more like photographed objects. I first used two plane lights with different colours to give a gradient like lighting on the shapes. I then found a way of adding a strong blur relating to the position of the squares. This gave an effect similar to shallow depth of field however It was far too strong to be even close to seeming realistic.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-531" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/firstRender.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="540" />

After making my first depth of field and not being pleased with the unrealistic look of the outcome I decided to look into using the camera tool in a more advanced and precise way. For this I looked online and fount that I had using the node editor was a way of giving more control over the camera. I saw that I could change the aperture which allowed me to give a shallow depth of field. I used an aperture of 4.5 which I knew would work as on my Cannon this gives a soft focus on background elements.

I also looked into the difference between the rendering quality and how the amount cycles gives a more cleaner render.

This render didn’t use alot of cycles for the render, this gives the image a pixel look and almost makes it look like a noise texture.This is the final render for the Depth of Field test, I liked the simplicity of the grid layout of the squares and how the colour change really emphasizes the focus on the square at the front.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-532" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/secondRender.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="540" />

Well when I say water the final outcome looks more like smoke than anything, The render was made in the blender render which is a lower quality render than the cycles render. This is not preferred as the texturing and lighting is not as realistic and the texturing is primitive. For the render I made a self containing square with another square inside. This allowed me to make a container with the larger square and making the inner square a fluid. I didn’t change the texturing of the fluid object as I knew the render wouldn’t look like water. The outcome instead looked more like steam, which actually was more impressive than my original idea. I will later look into making water with the cycles render however this will take some time especially if I render it in a decent quality.

For my first motion typography piece I decided to choose the gravity trailer as this could be interesting to do and play around the z-axis and depth of field. I chose to use different colour fonts for each character as this would separate them from each other and make it easier for the audience to follow.

I used animations on the position of the text to illustrate the movements of the characters , for instance spinning the whole sentence for the section where the female protagonist spins out of control away from the spaceship. I also animated the detach by making it seem to break away from the sentence. The outcome for these types of animation are effective however feel very expected and not original or creative. In my next kinetic typography piece I will try and make the depiction of the movement in the text more subtle which would create a more interesting piece which seemed more clean and creative. I was happy with this piece as the timing of the text and its readability was clear throughout the animation. I would have liked to look into animating the text with her breathing and making a subtle font size change to emphasise this.

<h2>Rise and Shine</h2>
For my second motion typography piece I wanted to improve on the design and subtle play of words to make it seem more thought about and creative. For this I chose an inspiration speech audio, I liked the audio for this as the tempo of the speech is changing throughout the clip and the words are clearly spoken which would make animating and emphasis on the words more prominent. For the video I chose to start nearer to the end so I could animate the build up to the ending. This would be more interesting that ending on a section of a video that was still building up. This way the ending of the video is shown and the whole piece is more finished and rounded.

For the placement of the text I wanted to be more precise than my previous work, so I decided to use the grid to line up my words and make them all aligned. This made the text clearer to read and gave a more revised feel. As well as using a grid to make the text aligned, I also used precise degrees when making the squares and corners of the shapes created by the text. This made the shapes created more structured and cleaner. I was particularly pleased with the final seconds of the video, by using a key framed opacity to illustrate the alarm clock. I felt this although seeming obvious was achieved in a way that it looked good and wasn’t expected.

<h2>The Logo</h2>
For the channel brief a logo was needed for our company. We first brainstormed ideas for a film and movie review channel. The idea was of a company was an internet based video service which showcased trailers and behind the scenes footage. When coming up with a brand name I wanted to have a name which would stand out and be short and easy to say. The name would also have to be related to videos or films. We brainstormed ideas such as Film Reviews, Scene and Movie Watch. We finally decided on the name ClipCut. After choosing this brand name I then went onto designing the logo. I wanted to incorporate either a film reel or use a cut-out or cut design by slicing the logo or text in half. The preliminary designs consisted of using the letter c. I then changed the direction of the second “C” to make a circle. I liked this design and continued using this concept through the designing process. I started making the circles very straight and used straight lines and hard edges to give the Impression of a cut out. I then changed this idea as it looked unprofessional and rushed and made a mock up in Adobe Illustrator using curves and a gradient on the text. Later this moved into Photoshop and was refined to a thinner design with a black and grey colour without the gradient. I was happy with this final design as it kept with the simplistic concept we had and the cut-out slice which I came up with in the planning.
<h2>Inspiration and Preparation</h2>
When we started the channel project we decided to choose 3d printing as our new technology. I looked at E3 the electronics exposition which had just taken place the week before and the new breakthroughs with 3d printing. I found out that 3d printing of sweets and food had advanced with small complex shapes being created and having a variety of shapes and colours. 3D Printing as well had advanced with more detailed and accurate prints being created with the many new 3D printers which are available to the general population. We then brainstormed what we could possibly highlight in our videos and website and how 3D printing could advance and what the outcomes and effects this could produce. We looked at the advantages in medicine and how prosthetic limbs could be printed as well as using stem cells to print skin or to heal wounds. As well as looking into the positives of 3D printing we also looked at the negatives and how 3D printing could be used by people to print guns and other weapons. We thought about how weapons for terrorism could be created easily as printing a working gun is already a thing. After this we thought about how 3D printing could increase in size and speed and what that could lead to. We then thought about poverty and how it may be possible to print buildings in the future and how this could be used in developing counties to help the poor.

After thinking about what the printer could do and the science behind it, we then went onto what our channel could be about, either a government based channel identifying the positives and negatives or the damages printing weapons could cause. We then decided to make a film trailer after watching the Jobs film. We saw how this new printer which could print anything could be similar to this. We came up with the idea of a female protagonist who designs a 3D printer which can print anything the designer chooses. We took inspiration from the story of Steve Jobs and how his original idea was not fully accepted. We chose this story progression as it would be effective to film and make the trailer dramatic and fit more with the idea for the trailer we were coming up with. After watching a short film “From 1994” we decided to use a child’s bedroom as one of the key locations for the trailer. The shot contained many drawings and toys so we decided to make a large collection of drawings and record our progress through a time-lapse. After coming up with the idea of using a child’s bedroom we then decided to use a monopoly house as something the protagonist would hold close to them. The house would be a representation of the homes which would be created by the new technology as well as something the character could link back to her childhood when she had dreams of creating this machine. The target audience for the trailer would be 17-35 year old’s and the channel would consist of film trailers and behind the scenes from films of all ages but predominately 15+ films.

<h2>Day 1</h2>
Day one we started at Alex’s house, we planned to film the bedroom scenes from the freak out to the realisation of the monopoly house. We started the day using one of the larger camera’s we had taken out, however found it hard to use and get the smooth shots we were after. Also when reviewing the footage on the laptop at the end of the day we realised the footage shot on my dslr was much more what we were after and decided to scrap using the larger camera and stick to the Cannon 550D. We also shot behind the scenes at the end of the day, where we asked each other how the day went and what had happened during the day. This footage would also be on the channel and act as an extra to the trailer to make the channel more enticing to the audience instead of it just showcasing trailers. We also took a time-lapse of us sketching out children’s drawings for the walls of the child’s bedroom and used this aswell in the behind the scenes footage.

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRCAU9iwePE?feature=oembed" width="100%" height="422" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
After reviewing the footage from the first day I decided to solely use the Cannon for filming the rest of the shots for the trailer and behind the scenes. We also started using a GoPro3 to capture our work before and during filming which we planned to use in the behind the scenes. This was achieved by placing the GoPro in the corner of the room and left on a time-lapse to capture images every 5 seconds, this when played at 24fps looked good and gave more of a time-scale to the work. On the second day we also had our main actress Rhia who plays Kate in the trailer to come and film some shots. We filmed the freak out scene in the bedroom and some cinematic shots down by the cliff side which would be the turning point of the trailer. We wanted these shots to be dramatic and heartfelt so I suggested we shot them at sunset as the lighting would give the shots more visual distinction and be aesthetically pleasing. I then shot a short behind the scenes at the coast talking about how we were using inbuilt mics on the camera so would have to re-record the audio for the shot where she states “i’m is coming home”.
<h2>Day 3</h2>
Day 3 was at uni, we filmed only two scenes and then started editing the trailer later on in the day. We first shot the lecture scene where the protagonist would be inspired to come up with the idea of the printer. We also shot the interview scene where Kate’s idea is destroyed and she becomes upset. For this scene composition was a main factor with the camera angle of the two boss’s of the firm and of Rhia. I used low medium shots on the interviewers and higher shots on Rhia to give them power and make her seem more insignificant. After this we shot the final scenes of the behind the scenes and rapped up the idea of the 3D printer and how we used it in the Channel Project.

Editing took about 6 days in total with rendering a 3D printer in Cinema 4D taking just over an hour to render and using Adobe After Effects CS6 for all the hovering screens and the tracking shots. I also had to input text onto all the behind the scenes shots however this was much quicker to do as editing to the time of the music and shot length didnt matter as much. For the trailer we started to look at electronic music as this fitted with the brief of the channel being in the future however this didnt reach the level of drama we wanted in the trailer. Alex then suggested we used an inspirational speech over the top of some soft strings however the use of this and text made the outcome confusing and hard to follow. Instead I came up with using an instrumental for a song and changing the speed which made it more dramatic and what we wanted. We then wanted to change the song in a later section of the trailer where the mood decreases and then ends on a climax. For this we looked into dramatic scenes in shows and films we watched and ended on the song Funeral by A Band of Horses. This particular song has a very sad feel however has a sudden jump to a louder and more uplifting section which would be better to end on. I then timed this up with “Kate” picking up the monopoly piece and the ending effect was particularly nice.

At the end of the editing I am happy with the end result however I wished I had spent more time getting some cuts and shot length just right as some parts of the trailer feel long or too short.

<h2>The Website</h2>
For the channel project we had to produce an accompanying website which would showcase the videos which we could produce. The channel would also have space to increase in size and be able to add new content. After coming up with the idea of ClipCut we wanted to keep with the simplistic design which would link with our company. So when designing the website we used simple textures and kept layout clean and easy to navigate. The logo is found on the website as well as sections to send questions and learn more about the film.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We were set the task of designing an independence poster for Dorset. Due to the fact that Scotland’s Independence was close to this time. When first starting to brainstorm ideas about Dorset we first started to think about all this things that can be represented by Dorset. This included the countryside and outdoors. This point was one of the main ideas behind Dorset, including castles, beautiful landscapes and the sea. These natural and aesthetic features meant that our outcome would have something to do with that.

When we started looking for ideas on independence we first looked at Scottish independence posters at that time and what they had in common. We found that many were very simplistic and plain to allow the reader to get the idea of the poster straight away and then walk along and carry on with their day. We also found out that the positioning of the poster would be in the lobby, an area in the building where students and lectures just walk through and not take much interest in. This meant that our poster would have to stand out and be eye catching to allow the busy moving observes to even see it.

We first started looking at word maps for inspiration when looking at posters. These posters including a map of the location and used its shape to in case words or phrases to do with the said location. We thought this would be a good way to show Dorset as it doesn’t have something that everyone really knows it for. Everyone we asked knew Dorset either for one thing or the other, and a clear path to follow was not obvious. I quite liked a poster found on maphugger.com, it used Wikipedia Article entries as a source to find the most common word that fits into a countries boundary. This design was also simplistic and the colours used were eye catching but not unpleasant to look at for a long time. The detail within the map was also rewarding to look at and find particular phrases that were small or hard to see. This made looking at the poster more interesting and almost forced me to look at the poster and read all of the words. This technique is very effective as the unordered layout makes reading it more enjoyable than a long list.

When first coming up with ideas we decided to incorporate a map of Dorset with the poster. This would show the whole of Dorset which may be more recognizable than a small castle or the pier in Bournemouth. This would mean we could start to convey the point straight away and give something that everyone may understand quickly.

I then made this poster..

<center>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-95" src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dorsetmap.jpg" alt="dorsetmap" width="500" height="auto" />
</center>

This poster used a lot of white space and used large san-serif font which made it clear and easy to read. I wanted to have some colour in the poster to make it more visually pleasing so made the map blue. For the title “Dorset England” we decided to blur the England type. This gave the suggestion that Dorset was not part of England anymore as it fades away into the background. I liked the simplicity of this however we found that the idea of the poster was not obvious as we wanted as some viewers didn't understand the concept.

We then went on the create this second poster, using the same word map as the previous poster.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-97" src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dorsetposter.jpg" alt="dorsetposter" width="750" height="500" />

This poster was much more interesting than the last, meaning that some people stopped and looked at the poster when walking through the lobby area. We liked the complexity inside the letters as in made people look closer and try and read the smaller type. This meant that people read all the describing and leading words to deduce what the poster represented and actually meant. I also prefer the colours chosen on the poster, as they stand out more than just the plain white poster background on the previous one.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Learning new software is always interesting, spending countless hours on trying to make something work then finally *pop* you realise that you forgot to put in a semi-colon or didn’t properly name something. After all that time you finally make something, something you wanted to make and it comes out just as you wanted, this is what really makes me happy. Processing is a java based application which allows you to create a whole lot of pretty and colourful pieces. These can be interactive and have the ability to add ‘libraries’ which allow cameras, microphones and even Kinects to be used to make interaction varied and interesting. But first as on all programs I need to learn how to do the basic Hello World..

</center>

<code>void setup() {
size(750, 300);
}
void draw() {
background(204);
line(width/2, height/2, mouseX, mouseY);
}
</code>

After learning how to write into the console I then went on to learn how to map mouse movement to change something on the screen. After making a 750px x 300px canvas I then added a line. This line starts at the centre of the canvas as the height and width are split in half. Then the other end of the line is mapped to mouseX and mouseY. This means when I move the mouse around the canvas the other end of the line is attached to the mouse. This experiment was pretty simple, but it shows that I could possibly change the mouse to something else later on and make it attach to a colour or object on a camera.

		<title>Processing 2 -  Simple Drawing Sketch</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After learning how the basic layout worked I wanted to create a simple drawing code. After seeing many examples of complex drawing sketches online I wanted to start my way towards creating something more complex. I first however wanted to make this, so started with a similar void setup and then went on to the draw. This section allowed me to choose the properties of the ellipse and were and how they are made. The two if statements allow both mouse click and right mouse click to be used. With right mouse click being a clear button, which makes the background back to the default value and so clearing all the paint on the canvas. Mouse pressed it set to the X and Y values of the mouse and given a size of 20x20px. This means that every time the mouse is pressed every second 60 ellipses should be drawn.

<code>
void setup() {
size(750, 450);
background(#CDCBCD);
frameRate(60);
}
<code>
void draw() {
stroke(255);
smooth(8);
if (mousePressed) {
ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 20,20);
}
if (mouseButton==RIGHT) {
background(#CDCBCD);
}
}
</code>

[video width="750" height="450" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" webm="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/simpledraw.webm"][/video]

<code>
void setup() {
size(992, 558);
background(#CDCBCD);
frameRate(60);
smooth(100);
}
void draw() {
stroke(random(255));
color(random(200));
smooth(8);
if (mousePressed) {
ellipse(mouseX+random(-100), mouseY+random(-100),5,5);
}
if (mouseButton==RIGHT) {
saveFrame("blog_4.jpg");
}
}</code>

As soon as I created a single circle I thought of how more than one could give more interest to the brush. If the shape and dispersion of the circles changed a textured brush could be shown. I then decided to make many random small ellipses appear when the left mouse button is pressed. This random value would provide a more interesting layout than one I could create. I also changed the right button press to a saveFrame value. This would give me a .jpg whenever I pressed the right mouse. This could also be set with every frame and could be used to make a short animation.

<img src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dots.jpg" alt="dots" width="750" height="auto" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109" />

After this we learned how to rotate the canvas and produce circular patterns. This is achieved by a repeated draw of a shape rotated around the centre point (width/2,height/2). I also used integers in this sketch, allowing me to apply calculations and make values of rotation and repetition. After making this sketch I applied a noStroke to remove the lines around the outside of the ellipses. This gave a much cleaner look to the pattern. I also made the fill increase to give a rainbow colour to the pattern as it progresses. This steady increase gives a smoother look to the animation.

<code>
void setup() {
size(750,750);
colorMode(HSB,100);
smooth();
noStroke();
}
int rotation=0;
int el=0;
int h=0;
void draw() {
fill(245,10);
rect(0,0,width,height);
translate(width/2,height/2);
rotate(rotation);
fill(h,100,100,25);
ellipse(el,el,el,el);
rotation=rotation+90;
el=(el+1)%150;
h=(h+1)%100;
}
</code>

		<title>Processing 3 - Image Manipulation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For our next lesson in processing we learnt about images and image manipulation. To add an image we name it and put it outside of the draw and setup void areas. With this we can recall the image with the name we give it later on in the draw void. The name I gave to the images was “img” and “img2”, this new class is called PImage.

<code>
void setup(){
img = loadImage("xbox1.jpg");
size(img.width,img.height);
smooth();
} 
</code>

<img src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/xbox.png" alt="xbox" width="750" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-117" />

<code>
tint(100,150,55); 
</code>

[video width="352" height="290" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" webm="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/catmouse.webm"][/video]
</center>

<code>
PImage img;
PImage img2;
PImage img3;
void setup (){
img = loadImage("cat1.jpg");
img2 = loadImage("cat2.jpg");
img3 = loadImage("cat3.png");
size(img.width,img.height);
smooth();
frameRate(60);
}
int n=3;
void draw(){
img.loadPixels();
// image(img,0,0);
for(int y=0; y for(int x=0; x int loc=x+(y*img.width);
stroke(img.pixels[loc]);
fill(img.pixels[loc]);
rect(x+random(mouseX/20),y+random(mouseY/20),20,20);
} 
if (mousePressed){
img=loadImage("cat1.jpg");
}
else {
img=img2;
}
}
textSize(100);
fill(0);
text ("CAT",10,100);
}
</code>

I also learn how to apply text to the sketch with the text placed at (10,100) When thinking about the x and y coordinates of the sketch I imagined an upside down grid. Where the x values run along the top side and the y values run along the left side. Using the same sketch I changed a few values of the image and replaced them with a cam.image instead. I then went on to change the “n” int to see what effects were produced.

I may look into ways I can replace the mouse movement with another input method, maybe for the brightest pixel or a colour that I could track. I know using a Kinect and tracking is possible but Ill have to see if I can learn this before the deadline.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well you could probably ask processing that, and you can. The time when you think about it is very complex to code. Depending on what time zone you are in the time is different, similarly depending what time of the year and if it’s a leap year it’s also different. So when I first heard we were going to learn how to make a clock in processing I was looking forward to lots and lots of code. Luckily this code and these many additions and occurrences have been done before so it’s actually not that hard.

First we start with a normal void setup and then add some integers. These are the give the values of the hour minute second…
<code>
int h=hour();
int m=minute();
int s=second();
int y=year();
int mo=month();
int d=day();
</code>

Then after this in the draw section we just input these values in and add some colour to the background (fill) and maybe even change the font. I also then have to place the text on the x and y coordinates so they are in order. After this I have a working digital clock sketch.

However this isn’t that interesting so I decided I could make it a little bit more interesting, I remembered a website I had seen a white ago and went searching. http://whatcolourisit.scn9a.org/ is a website which shows the Hex colour at that time, so as an example at three forty in the afternoon (15:40:00) the hex value would be #154000. I thought this was an interesting concept and decided I would do the same but inside processing. I then just used the int value for the seconds and input that into the first value of the background colour.

<code>
background(s,100,100); 
</code>

The result shows a bright background throughout the whole minute, this was what I was after as using the hours and days took too long and meant that the average viewer to the site wouldn’t see the whole colour spectrum and the change of colour I wanted to show.

After this I wanted to make something a bit more strange and complex. I chose to add a translate and rotate to the sketch. This rotation was on the rectangles which I added and the text as well. I set the length of the second hand to the number of the second, and also used the other values for hour and minutes. I did spend a lot of time trying to get it just right however what I came up with is in my eyes much funnier. The clock is almost unreadable after it is left to run for a few minutes and as the layers build up you are just left with a mass of colour as the change is so slight and takes hours.. (Literally). Overall I may come back to this at a later date and make this clock again, but for now I enjoy my messy unreadable clock.

<code>
void setup(){
size(750,750);
frameRate(1);
colorMode(HSB,100);
}
int rotation=0;
void draw(){
translate(width/2,height/2);
fill(#000000);
rotation=rotation+6;
rotate(rotation);
//set the variables up for the time and date
int h=hour();
int m=minute();
int s=second();
int y=year();
int mo=month();
int d=day();
textSize(30);
stroke(0,0,0);
strokeWeight(0);
//Display Seconds
textSize(20);text(s,s*4,20,20);
fill(s,100,100);
rect(0,0,s*4,10);
//Display Minutes
textSize(30);
fill(m+s,100,100);
rect(0,20,m+200,10);
text(m,m+220,40,30);
//Display Hours
textSize(40);
fill(h+s,100,100);
rect(0,40,h+300,10);
text(h,h+300,50,50);
}

		<title>Processing 5 - Velocity &amp; Gravity</title>
		<link>http://localhost/wordpress/2015/01/14/processing-5-velocity-gravity/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After learning how to make objects inside processing we learn how to add gravity to the sketch. This was again much easier than I thought it would be. It is down to a class called PVector.

<code>
force = new PVector(0.0, 0.1, 0.0);
</code>

This makes a new vector each cycle so that a force like gravity or a push or pull force is only created each update. We can then add an if statement to allow the mouse to control when the force is applied.

<code>
if (mousePressed){
force.add(mouseForceTo(centre));
}
</code>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-123" src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vector.png" alt="vector" width="750" height="auto" />

To prevent the ball from flying away and outside of the sketch when the force is applied to it we add. Without this if a force is applied to the ball it would continue traveling and go outside of the boundaries of the sketch and be unable to be seen.

This can also be done by reversing the gravity of the sketch. When the ball hits the edge of the sketch the speed is reversed and gives the impression that the ball bounces off the edge. This could also be extended on and multiplied each time by .9 therefore reducing the speed in which the ball travels after hitting with a wall. This is like making the ball loose some of its energy when connecting with the wall and then continuing with less energy.

</center>

Speed and the gravity can be changed but this is all very interesting. Changing these values and making larger objects seem to be slower can also increase the believability of a complex gravity system. Applying a force behind an object reminded me a lot of Osmos and how using an objects weight forced it to move. Remaking this game in the processing engine may be something I will look into doing in my spare time as this is very similar to the mechanics of the game.

		<title>Processing 6 - Webcam Processing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Using a webcam in processing allows me to make a sketch much more accessible and interactive than a mouse based interactive sketch. This allows the users to just walk in-front of the camera and see the effects produced by processing on the screen. For my project in processing we were tasked into creating an interactive piece that will be placed in the lobby area of the building.

When researching the area I found out that most of the people who move through the area do not stay for long. Most people make a direct route through the area to get to their classes and do not take that much interest into what is on the screens or on the walls in the room. This meant that making something that was very interactive and took time to explain was pretty much off the table straight away. To make sure I interviewed a few students who were sitting down on the seats to see the reason. They were waiting for their next class and were just talking and eating on the tables. The coffee shop downstairs also means other people were sitting at the tables on their laptops enjoying a hot beverage.

So primarily I thought of creating something that could be fast and quick to decipher and understand before the individual moves away from the area. This would bring the same skills across for the Dorset Project I did recently where creating an eye catching design was key. The design would have to be quick to make clear and allow someone who is in a rush to quickly interact with the piece without hardly slowing down or changing their direction. Using a camera based sketch was therefore ideal, as well as using one of the several screens in the room to display the sketch output to make viewing the interaction simple and easy. Before I started brainstorming ideas I made a simple camera sketch.

<code>
import processing.video.*;
Capture cam;
void setup() {
size(640, 480);
cam = new Capture(this,640,480,30);
cam.start();
frameRate(30);
smooth();
//println(Capture.list());
}
void draw(){
if (cam.available()) { 
// Reads the new frame
cam.read(); 
} 
image(cam, 0, 0); 
}
</code>

This allowed me to picture the environment of the space and picture what would go through the minds of the people if they saw previous sketches I have produced on a public screen for all to see. If everyone can see what they see it may not be so intimate and personal. This means I can’t really do anything along those lines as to not offend anyone. I have decided to try and use some sort of tracking to allow the movements of the people as they move through the space react to the sketch. This way I can leave it running and do not have to explain or help anyone, they can choose what to do with the interaction as they wish.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Firstly I started with an example sketch of movement tracking, this allows the camera to visualize only the movement on the screen and make it only show. This is done by using a black and white contrast and showing the moving pixels in white and the background in black. By using this sketch I will be able to use these calculations to allow the camera to track the movement. Tracking the movement is done by saving the previous frame and then comparing it to the next. Where the change is the white colour is visualised, showing where the movement was.

After looking at this tracking I then went onto using this sketch to show the movement in a specific place. This would allow me to place an object or a shape onto the position to where the movement has been made. Removing the values for the display colour to be black and white when movement was shown was also carried out. After doing this the ability to calculate the x and y values of the movement was given and I found out how to make an ellipse show where the movement was instead of black and white.

</center>

Using this I then thought about what I could replace the ball with, I then thought about what my housemates would hate following them. I decided to replace the ball with a spider and then test it on them. Both of them dislike spiders however I would also test out the usability of the sketch as well as ask them about it and what they found good or bad about it, so I could find ways to improve it.

I chose to use a white spider only because it would show up more when I was testing it out. I was wearing a black t-shirt so making the spider white made it show up when the black ball sometimes went out of vision.
<h2>First Tests</h2>
I decided to show my housemates my work before seeing how the sketch would work inside the lobby area. I wanted it to be pretty much complete before even testing it there so making small changes now were easier before the proper testing. The environment was more personal and therefore their reactions may be different to what would have been made in public. I also allowed them to test the sketch directly from my laptop so their intimacy with the sketch was again higher than in the lobby area. I first tested the sketch on Kelly.

<center>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132" src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kelly.png" alt="kelly" width="300" height="300" />
</center>

Kelly probably dislikes spiders the most so the reaction from her was going to be as expected, however because she was standing away from the laptop the spider wasn’t as obvious as I would have liked and so she didn’t really react to it. She said that the white colour gave it the look of a computer mouse and only by looking closer did she realise it was a spider. As she interacted with the sketch she was moving from one side of the room to the other, trying to get away from the spider. She was scared of it chasing her and therefore moved around to try and avoid it. From testing the sketch on Kelly I found out that the spider was too small to be seen and even on the bigger screens of the lobby this would still be the case. I also found out that the colour would be important and that depending on the environment the colour of the spider would have to contrast it and stand out to be obvious.

<center>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133" src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rhia.png" alt="rhia" width="300" height="300" /></center>

I wasn’t sure how Rhia would react to the sketch as her fear of spiders is somewhat gone since moving to the house this year. She did however notice the spider faster than Kelly as she was sitting with the laptop on her lap. She also displayed a different reaction to Kelly, instead of trying to move away from the Spider she was forced to stay still as the Laptop was on her lap. This changed the way she interacted to the piece. As she couldn’t more she explored ways to move the spider and control where it was on the screen. She also tried to catch the spider in her hands and hit it. This showed me that interaction was going to be very different from one viewer to the next.
<h2>After the Test</h2>
I will now change the size and design of the spider. I will make the spider larger than the 50x50 .png that it is now to a larger size. This will make the spider more obvious and make the connection that the image is a spider easier and quicker. I will also change the colour of the spider. This will make it stand out in the brightly coloured lobby area, and maybe add to the immersion of the piece. By making these changes hopefully the sketch will be more enticing and make the reaction to the piece clearer. I may also look into making the spider more real and lifelike. When talking to Rhia she said she wanted to interact with the spider, to move it of make it do something when she tries to hit it.. This AI work may be too complex to add however making the spider more lifelike will be where I start. I may see if changing the png to a gif is possible as this animation to the legs may make the spider seem more real and stand out on the screen.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Processing 8 - The Open CV Library</title>
		<link>http://localhost/wordpress/2015/01/20/processing-8-the-open-cv-library/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Open cv is a library you can add do Processing, this is done in the sketch tab and can be used to add a lot of information and add sources to your sketch easily and quickly. I have used the video library in the past this is done either through this tab, or by adding something like this at the very top of your sketch.

<center>
<img src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sf1.jpg" alt="sf1" width="637" height="477" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-142" />
</center>

<code>
import processing.video.*;
import gab.opencv.*;
</code>

Other libraries include, Kinect , audio and other vision based libraries. These can be used to add devices such as the Kinect or a microphone to the sketch so detect sound and or a 3d depth map. With this information the library makes it easy to add this data to your sketches and play around with the information. This way you can create a depth map that reacts to sound or a sound that starts a video camera and makes it take a screenshot. The list of things you can do is pretty much limitless and is being updated with new libraries every day.

For the openCV library I used it to track my face. After testing the Spider Sketch on my housemates I wanted it to be more dramatic and make it easier to react to more than one person like it would be in the lobby. I didn’t want the experience to be only fixed on one person but make it be available to everyone as they pass the screen. I thought about this and added the spider to the place where the frontal face square is shown. By doing this I replaced the square with the spider image and so whenever the camera reads a frame where the face is shown it will apply the spider to the face. The outcome is quite good however I still need to try and improve some things.

<center>
<img src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sf2.jpg" alt="sf2" width="634" height="475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-143" />
</center>

The image used of the spider is very low quality, this was the same spider used in the previous version of my Spider Sketch. However due to the fact that the spider image would resize depending on the size of the face made it become obvious very quickly that the image was too low resolution. I then went and made a new larger spider image to remove this issue.

<center>
<img src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sf3.jpg" alt="sf3" width="637" height="476" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-144" />
</center>

After this I wanted to make the spider have more depth and be more than just a png layered ontop of the face. I decided to give the spider a shadow as this would make its appearance more real and make the png less flat and lifeless. The result is pretty good, as much as the spider does still look fake, the shadow adds some more realism to it.

</center>

I finally made the spider a bit bigger to make the spider more apparent when viewed from further away. I did this as when testing the Sketch I couldn’t clearly see it when I was standing 10foot away from the camera. This distance would be the max distance my sketch would properly work on, and it would encourage users further away that are still picked up by the face tracking to come closer and see what was on their face. The code below is the final version of my sketch.

<code>
import processing.video.*;
import gab.opencv.*;
import java.awt.Rectangle;
//
OpenCV opencv;
Capture cam;
Rectangle[] faces;
//
PImage img;
//
void setup() {
size(640, 480,P2D);
img = loadImage("LARGESPIDER2.png");
// Start capturing
cam = new Capture(this, 640, 480);
cam.start();
//
//
opencv = new OpenCV(this, cam.width, cam.height);
//
//
opencv.loadCascade(OpenCV.CASCADE_FRONTALFACE); 
//opencv.loadCascade(OpenCV.CASCADE_EYE); 
//opencv.loadCascade(OpenCV.CASCADE_NOSE); 
}
//
// New images from camera
void captureEvent(Capture cam) {
cam.read();
}
//
void draw() {
//
background(0);
//
opencv.loadImage(cam);
//
faces = opencv.detect();
//
image(cam, 0, 0);
//
if (faces != null) {
for (int i = 0; i < faces.length; i++) {
strokeWeight(2);
stroke(255,0,0);
noFill();
//rect(faces[i].x, faces[i].y, faces[i].width, faces[i].height);
image(img, faces[i].x, faces[i].y, (faces[i].width)*1.2, (faces[i].
height)*1.2); 
}
}
}]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When testing the final outcome I wanted the audience to not notice they were being filmed straight away. I wanted the piece to be just a screen on its own, almost like a camera just monitoring people who came in and out of the building. This meant that not everyone would see the piece however displaying it like this made it fit into the surroundings and made itself not obvious and setup as it could have been. I did this to almost reward people who noticed it, who briefly looked up and as they did were shocked to see the spider that had appeared on their face. Making it not seem like an piece of work and just as a security camera made this again be less obvious and more for people who saw and looked for it. This meant that also the interaction was very personal, like the original sketches I did back at home. The movement to an open space where lots of people are made the sketch very impersonal. However by making it only when a person looks directly at the screen and sees themselves is when they see the spider, makes the piece more personal. When someone looks at a person interacting with the piece they may not see the spider as they are not looking directly at the screen and camera. By doing this I made the transition from a very personal space to a public space without losing the level of intimacy in the interaction with the Sketch.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-149" src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/test1.jpg" alt="test1" width="750" height="auto" />

When testing the sketch most people understood what was going on as they saw themselves in the screen. After a few seconds some realised that the camera only picked up their faces if they were front facing the screen, and some realised it was tracking their face. The piece however was missed by some passers-by and just thought it was a security camera feed. The placement of the screen could have been better, by placing it in a line of sight where everyone was looking. Having a screen on the doors on an elevator for instance as most people look directly at that spot for at least 20 seconds.

<img src="http://www.matthewlean.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/test2-1024x683.jpg" alt="test2" width="750" height="auto" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-150" />

Looking back I would have liked to spend more time on creating more life and depth to the spider. I would have liked to improve on the detection of the faces, as sometimes a spider would randomly appear off on a wall as it had detected a contrast it may have thought was a face. I would have also liked to add some variation with the spider as well, maybe each time a face was detected another different spider from a large library of spiders was given depending on the colour of the clothes worn by the individual. I would have also liked to give some animation to the spider as well, so make it seem more lifelike. Implementing AI would have been the last leap I would have liked to do, if it was possible to make the spider crawl around the face and interact with the audiences actions to more it. This however was probably not possible and I believe that the level I was at the time meant I could only produce what I made then.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After testing my sketch in the Lobby I questioned the individuals who participated in the sketch. I did this to get some feedback on how I could possibly improve with my processing and design and how to present pieces of work in a public place.
<h2>What did you think about the Interactive Display?</h2>
-It was very interesting, I liked how the spider got bigger as you got closer to the camera and the spider filled your face.

-Simplistic installation with a dramatic effect and something about illusion.
<h2>What did you like about the piece?</h2>
-I liked how the spider follows where your face is, and how it just sticks to your face.

-I was scared at first, as I’m really scared of spiders, but then I realised it was just following my face so it was quite funny.
<h2>What could be improved?</h2>
-I would like it to be a kitten, as I don’t like spiders.
-I liked it however it was obvious that the spider wasn’t real, make it more real, make it move or something.

Looking back at the decision I made to change from the movement tracking to face tracking may have been not the best decision. After testing the sketch on my laptop I experienced a massive fps drop when making the sketch full screen to fit the monitor. This is probably down to my own 2 year old laptop and its graphics card being quite old and not really up to scratch. Throughout the testing I had been using my computer so this was not seen until I ran the sketch though the monitor. I would have liked also to use an external camera and hide the laptop or computer powering the sketch if I made this again. This would just make the setup more professional and more thought out, and would remove the feeling of a little student project to something that was backed by the Uni or been put up by the university. This would make the interactions more formal and therefore the thoughts about the piece would be more professional.

When I was brainstorming ideas I wanted originally for the spider to be always there, whenever anyone was on the screen the spider would always be on them. This would be illustrating being watched and the forever present idea of security and identity. That we are never really alone and we are always being watched by something or someone. This idea was extended by the face tracking sketch. By using this I made this point hopefully clearer. Only when the viewer looks into the screen they are being watched and put in the spotlight. I am reasonable happy with the outcome however would have liked to learn more about processing and become more comfortable with more complex coding structures and libraries. I may look into other libraries supported by processing in the future because using it throughout the past few months has been fun and rewarding.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Website Design</h2>
<a href="http://www.foor.co.uk/" target="_blank">Foor</a> is a company which specializes in triathlon wetsuits, the main models are the Foor Classic, Foor Quantum, Foor Quantum 2.4 and the Foor Synflex. When I was on my placement at TriUk I was given the task of redesigning and maintaining the Foor website, updating imagery, links and giving it a more modern look.

I wanted the Foor website to be very minimalist and use alot of white space, this would make the page look much more modern and make the wetsuits show up more on the page. I started with a colour scheme.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-483" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/foorcolourscheme.png" alt="" width="750" height="100" />

Foor wetsuits use these colours to differentiate between the different wetsuits, I thought this would work well as a highlight on the product pages, as this would show up well in contrast to the whites and greys i'm using for the backgrounds. After making the colour pallet I made a draft in Photoshop of the pages which would be on the Foor website.

Using the design I then coded the website from scratch trying to keep to my initial design as much as possible. The website as of March 2016 is shown below.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Initial Idea</h2>
Firstly I started thinking about personal experience with going on trips and outings to places of attraction. With this I thought about quizzes and questionnaires that I answered and other tasks and challenges children would participate in to make the trip more interesting.<!--more-->Thinking about this I decided to design a quiz app using simple screens and UI to make it accessible to a wide target audience of children to middle aged adults, who could interact and use the app without hassle. This also allows the large amount of overseas visitors to understand the app without little knowledge of the English language. The app would act as a tour style format, with questions answered in order to encourage movement around the Cathedral. For my design inspiration I looked at Google’s Material design and the visual principles that apply. I liked the use of shapes and thought this would work with the minimalistic look for the app.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After forming a small agency to work in ,we have been discussing our initial ideas and moodboards, which factors of each group members idea’s would work well and should be taken forwards, and how to develop two ideas which best fulfil the clients needs.
<h2>Initial Idea</h2>
We had all agreed on developing a game targeting families. This is due to the fact that we believed not many other groups will be creating apps which engage families, and we have observed from our first visit to the cathedral that one of the main visitors are families and groups, therefore they will be a good target audience. Our game will be a simple pictured based quiz which aims to strengthen the audiences interaction with the space, by making them find visual and historical information within the cathedral.

It will also foster family interaction between them and through the space. The aim of the quiz is to enhance the family experience as a group while having fun and gaining knowledge about the cathedral and Magna Carta.

We chose not to progress too much into the design aspects of the app until we had finalised which idea we would proceed with, however we all agreed that the design would be simplistic line drawings as this creates a clean look.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-466" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/New-App-Design_2.png" alt="" width="3219" height="2177" />

In order to present this idea to the client, we highlighted several key problems we could have if we keep this idea, and their solutions.

– PROBLEM: How to make family interact as a group?
– SOLUTION: Making it a competition, adults vs children

– PROBLEM: How to make it interesting to both, adults and kids?
– SOLUTION: Questions that are challenging to both of them at proportional levels

– PROBLEM: How to prevent isolation from the space?
– SOLUTION: Making them to find the solution in the space

– PROBLEM: How to make it engaging and not dull?
– SOLUTION: Image based quiz which places the attention into the space rather than into the screen
<h2>Initial Idea Feedback</h2>
After presenting our two initial ideas to RedBalloon, it has been decided to take forward and develop the Family Quiz idea. This idea was chosen because it fulfilled the clients needs in being both educational and interactive, and also targets families unlike ideas presented by other groups.

RedBalloon presented us with a few suggestions, such as giving the user the option of choosing avatars such as a baron, a knight, a peasant etc. This is to make our quiz directly connect to Magna Carta.

Some further questions Red Balloon presented to us to think about were as follows:

– Will the quiz be in the form of text Q &amp; A or multiple choice?

– Will there be any imagery used for quiz questions/answers?

– Do they score points – simple tally to win or something more?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Salisbury Cathedral App Project - Design Mockups</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After talking with my group about the initial design of and going head with my design idea I then went onto making a slightly more fleshed out design, which showed my new ideas and changes to my initial design.
I also went and created all the shapes used in the game for all the questions. My idea was to make at least 2 similar shapes and 2 which are incorrect. This made designing all the shapes quite easy when the questions where decided upon. This also helped as I took many pictures during our 3 visits to Salisbury Cathedral.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-461" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Untitled-1.png" alt="" width="3970" height="1529" />

&nbsp;
<h2>The Design and Alterations</h2>
The app design has changed in small ways throughout the input of the client and from our group and the way we wanted the app to be presented. At the start of the design the app was predominantly white with a few bright primary colours which stood out and surrounded the answers to the questions for the app. I also designed the app to have a minimalistic feel to it, to make navigation and visual aids easy to understand. The app was also presented in a specific way, with the main buttons being circular and the answers having a similarly bright outline to them.

After being given the colour scheme and visiting the Cathedral in our own time, we decided to change the main design of the app to fit in with the rest of the exhibit and the other graphics used by Red Balloon. This meant removing the white background and replacing it with a cream colour which matched the colour palette. After looking around the exhibition I realised that the bright colours in contrast would not fit but instead have a two tone colour scheme which would accent the content but not make each piece of content fight for the attention of the audience. This level of hierarchy would allow the app to have order and allow subtle visual pointers for easy navigation of the app.

As well as redesigning the app colour scheme I also changed the way the apps buttons and navigation was displayed. This was now done through much larger buttons which gave the app a much more full feeling. This is shown not only in the navigation and menus but also on the question pages. We also made small changes to the apps main page and in particular the logo for the app. We were originally using the Cathedral Logo however found that the logo used by Red Balloon portrayed the importance of shapes even in the content of their own work.

The main change for the app however was in the design style of the questions. We decided that the use of shapes would be a large factor which made our app stand out and be visually pleasing. When looking around the Cathedral for questions we found that a large proportion of the categories were to do with the Architecture and the shapes found within the space. This led us to make our app all to do with the shapes found within the Cathedral. When first thinking about the idea of representing the whole church through shapes we first went to take pictures. This allowed us to show the audience the space and question them on what was different or which shape fitted where. This led to confusion and on a design point very lacking. This led our group to come up with representing the shapes as line drawings. This collectively made the shapes come together where the pictures were lacking. The shapes were designed with similar weight and size and gave the whole app a continued aesthetic. This linked the whole building together and made the app have a continued feel which would have been broken apart by the pictures. The use of shapes not only allowed for a design aspect to be applied but also a practical aspect. The use of simple shapes makes the app very accessible to a large audience. Many overseas visitors come to the Cathedral and the app would provide a simple way of experiencing the space without a large amount of knowledge on the language. The use of shapes also makes the app accessible to families and in particular young children who we were targeting previously at the beginning stages of the design]]></content:encoded>

		<title>TriUk - 2016 Catalogue</title>
		<link>http://localhost/wordpress/2016/05/06/triuk-2016-catalogue/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-451" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/triuk_catalogue_banner.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="317" />

Near to the end of last year I started with a small team, designing the TriUk 2016 catalogue. The catalogue would be an information point to be handed out at events and in store. The catalogue would contain all the current bike brands of the shop as well as component, tools and clothing used by triathletes.<!--more-->

We started with the initial layout and guidelines we would set out when designing the catalogue. This would be done to be consistent with layout and keep the catalogue looking as a whole product instead of many singly designed pages. Working in a team also made this important as all the members using the same layout made the process a lot quicker.

Before starting the design, we looked at the previous catalogues and saw what issues we would draw upon them to make our design improve from previous years. We noticed that some bike images were scaled down excessively to fit in all the text (another thing we didn’t like) the design seemed to try and fit in as much information as possible without thinking about what the audience would want to see clearly; the product.

After talking about this we went on to draft the house style, starting with the initial page layout, colour pallet and product information and containers. We also decided to go use Open Sans for our typeface as the whole family contained many styles and sizes which would be ideal for our use.

<center><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-448" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/triukcataloguehousestyle1.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="646" /></center><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-460" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/triukcataloguedraftlayout.jpg" alt="" width="1249" height="437" />

After making the initial house style we went onto designing the page layout and background which would run throughout the whole catalogue.

The background needed to incorporate the red of the TriUk brand and not be too distracting to take the attention away from the reader. For the design we needed to make a 3d shape or mesh with a modern tech feel. I decided this would be best created in Cinema4D a software I was familiar with and started prototyping designs. My initial designs used a white background and larger ball connectors to emphasize them.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-459" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/triukc_atalogue_render_1.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1080" />

I later changed this design to make the product containers which were white to stand out more. I chose a much darker background which also matched my redesign for the TriUk main page, enforcing consistency for the brand. For the final background I reduced the ball size and kept the thin white lines as the contrast they added from the background made them stand out.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-457" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/triuk_catalogue_render_2.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1080" />

After making the background I decided to have the main body inside a 50% opacity dark container. I also decided then to make the gaps between all the containers and text as 42px, keeping consistency throughout the design.

The next step in the process was contacting the various companies which had expressed interest in being in the catalogue. This was done by myself only to keep email correspondence easier to follow.

Over the next few weeks I sent many emails to all the company media departments and brand managers to discuss the current design and layout of their page. After all the discussion was over with the design and content of the pages, we got confirmation to print the pages.

After sending off the catalogue to print we also had the idea to link to a physical copy of the catalogue on the TriUk website. We used a pdf viewer for in-browser viewing and linked all the products to the corresponding pages.

Below is a selection of a few of the pages I designed by myself.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Black Friday - Homepage Redesign</h2>
TriUk.com is an eCommerce website which sells bikes and triathlon gear. The main page highlights the newest deals and is the most important page on the site. The page also links to promotions, deals and in-store features which the Yeovil based shop offers.

<!--more-->

I was given the task of redesigning the main page of the website to give it a more up to date modern look. The design had to make the page easier to navigate, read and be able to easily transferred over to the mobile site.

As a comparison here is the website before and after, showing the changes I made to the layout and style of the main page.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-447" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/triuk_mainpagedesign_beforeafter.jpg" alt="" width="2405" height="1620" />

The design release was going to be for the Black Friday deals, so when thinking about layout the design had to incorporate some features that could possibly be used in the Black Friday weekend or in the future.

Starting with the responsive and changeable layout I decided to use a grid based design, with content being rectangular or squared. This way changing the layout of the design would be simple and adding new different sized blocks could be done to facilitate new ideas and features to the site. This easy editing would make changing the design in the future to be easy and allow the business to promote new products and keep the design looking new and fresh.

I started looking at the layout of the site as a whole and because the redesign was only going to be on the main page and the Black Friday custom page the design had to not contrast too much with the rest of the site.

As new products and deals would be the highlight for the page I decided to make the top section of the page dedicated to this. I also added some spaces for banner ads, one large square and another smaller rectangle. These would cycle through new products, deals and in-store experiences such as the bike fitting or pool. I also added a flash deal section underneath for the Black Friday weekend. This would highlight deals with only a short period of time in which they would be available, making the weekend deals a more changing and interesting time.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-458" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/triuk_redesign_section_1.jpg" alt="" width="1544" height="1408" />

I was also briefed to promote the social media somehow in the design. I decided to add some blocks within the grid for the Instagram and have links to all the social media at the bottom of the page.

The finished design for the TriUk main page for the 2016 Black Friday weekend deals is below.

After this I also made a custom Black Friday Deals page, using the same grid layout. During this page design I also added the two countdown clocks to the design as we had the pages ready a week before Black Friday.

A group of my friends wanted a logo and mascot created for a team they were possibly making for an upcoming tournament and asked me if I could put something together for them. They gave me free creative freedom with my design. I ended up looking at American Football team mascots and the style of using an animal with some bold outlined text.<!--more--> This style led me to consider the name Raptors and to use the <em>Velociraptor </em>genus as the team mascot.

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-442" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/outlineraptorslogo.png" alt="" width="766" height="672" />

I started creating the text part of the logo in Illustrator first, starting with a font and using create outlines to allow me to edit the size and structure of the font. I then added a dark outline to the text to make the green stand out more and to match the outlined American Football team style. I also gave the text a shadow, by copying the layer behind and connecting the edges to the shadowed darker text layer behind it. I finally gave the text a slant and readjusted the first R to make it match the other more fuller at the end of the word.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-443" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/raptorsTextLogo.png" alt="" width="4327" height="1479" />

I then moved onto the graphic of the mascot, starting with an outline of the shape of the head of a <em>Velociraptor </em>then adding more detail and outlines to give the face more structure and shape. I finally added some feathers by instruction of one of the team members and made it breath fire to make the mascot seem more fierce.

The final design is below. I am happy with the outcome and will definitely try this style again in the future as it was a good learning experience and gave a good result.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EU Dota2 Discord Community</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The EU Dota2 Discord Community was founded in the start of 2016. Discord is VoIP (VoiceOverIP) designed for gaming communities. The community website needed to give a clean and modern looking front and also to promote the new forum which was in the process of being created.<!--more-->

I started with the sections of the websites, these would show features of the community.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-439 size-full" src="http://matthewlean.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/discordSection.png" alt="" width="1104" height="388" />

The website colour scheme was based on the Discord colour palette which made the look of the website to link to the Discord UI and show the relationship both the community and the software has. After creating sections on the amount of users, games and the forum the admins were happy with the design.
<h2>Forum Design</h2>
The forum design was another project I completed. This included many features which would take some time to create so acted like more of a reference point for the forum. I designed profile areas , showing pinning features and starred posts to show what could become of the forum after it had grown.
